Introduction
This annotation dataset is firstly used in the paper 
"Coupled Multi-Layer Attentions for Co-Extraction of Aspect and Opinion Terms". 

The annotations are made on the customer review dataset from SemEval Challenge 2015 Task 12 Subtask 1. 
The annotation from the challenge only contains aspect term labels. 
We create opinion term labels for the same customer review sentences.

Description
The annotation contains 2 files corresponding to customer reviews from restaurant domain for both training and testing. 
For training, the file contains opinion term annotations for 1315 training sentences
(These reviews are the same as the ones in the challenge.) 
Each line in the annotation file lists all the opinion terms separated by ",". 
Each opinion term is followed by "+1" or "-1" indicating the opinion polarity. 
The order of the annotations is in line with the order of the original review texts. 
"NIL" indicates there is no explicit opinions for the corresponding review text.
